Project is about generating an ensemble of random bits using MATLAB & mapping the bits to three different line codes
Then for each line code caluclate:

1- The statistical mean. 
2- The ensemble autocorrelation function Rx(Ï„).  
3- The time mean and autocorrelation function for one waveform. 
4- The bandwidth of the transmitted signal.
